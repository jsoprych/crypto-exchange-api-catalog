4. Add US access restriction testing automation

## 🔧 Technical Tasks Per Exchange

### Core Tasks (Estimated: 1-2 hours per exchange)
- [ ] **Research**: API documentation review
- [ ] **Configuration**: Add to `config/settings.py`
- [ ] **Adapter**: Create `src/adapters/{exchange}_adapter.py`
- [ ] **Registration**: Add to `spec_generator._create_adapter()`
- [ ] **Discovery**: Run `python3 main.py discover --vendor {exchange}`
- [ ] **Mappings**: Create `src/scripts/create_{exchange}_mappings.py`
- [ ] **Testing**: Run `test_exchange_coverage.py {exchange}`
- [ ] **Verification**: Check coverage > 50% for ticker

### Optional Enhancement Tasks
- [ ] **US Access Test**: Verify connectivity from US-based server
- [ ] **Product Count**: Record number of discovered products
- [ ] **Derivative Support**: Add perpetual/futures mappings if available
- [ ] **REST Endpoints**: Map additional REST endpoints beyond ticker
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and edge cases

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- [ ] **25 exchanges** integrated with WebSocket ticker mappings
- [ ] **Average coverage > 65%** across all exchanges
- [ ] **All exchanges** passing normalization tests
- [ ] **> 250 field mappings** total (from current 130)
- [ ] **< 2 hours** average implementation time per new exchange
- [ ] **100% US access documentation** for all exchanges

### Qualitative Goals

- [ ] **Template-based adapter** generation working
- [ ] **Bulk configuration management** implemented
- [ ] **Coverage optimization** for low-coverage exchanges
- [ ] **Production-ready CLI** for exchange management

## 📅 Estimated Timeline

### Week-by-Week Plan

- Complete Bitstamp integration (DONE)
- Create this TODO list
- Start Bitget integration
- Develop automated exchange setup script

**Week 2**
- Complete 5 exchanges (Bitget, BitMart, Crypto.com, Gemini, Poloniex)
- Implement bulk configuration management
- Test automated setup process

**Week 3**
- Complete 4 exchanges (Bittrex, Deribit, Phemex, LBank)
- Extend to order_book data type for top 10 exchanges
- Optimize low-coverage exchanges

**Week 4**
- Complete 5 exchanges (WhiteBIT, Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, Zaif)
- Reach 25 exchanges total
- Implement production CLI enhancements
- Final verification and documentation

## 🛠️ Automation & Tooling Needed

### Priority 1: Exchange Setup Automation
```python
# add_exchange.py --name bitget --base-url https://api.bitget.com --ws-url wss://ws.bitget.com
# Should:
# 1. Create adapter from template
# 2. Add to config/settings.py
# 3. Register in spec_generator.py
# 4. Run initial discovery
# 5. Generate mapping template
```

### Priority 2: Bulk Configuration Management
- YAML-based exchange configuration
- Batch discovery operations
- Parallel testing framework
- Coverage reporting dashboard

### Priority 3: Enhanced Testing
- US accessibility automated testing
- Rate limit compliance verification
- WebSocket connection stability tests
- Historical data consistency checks

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### US Access Challenges
- Bybit requires VPN/proxy for US-based discovery
- Some Korean exchanges (Upbit, Bithumb) may have IP restrictions
- Document all restrictions clearly in US_ACCESS_RESTRICTIONS_REPORT.md

### Regional Focus
- Prioritize exchanges with unique regional coverage:
  - Asia: Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, Zaif
  - Europe: WhiteBIT, Bitstamp
  - LATAM: Bitso (if added)
  - Global: Bitget, Crypto.com

### Data Type Expansion
After reaching 25 exchanges:
1. Extend order_book mappings to all exchanges
2. Add trade/candle mappings to top 15 exchanges
3. Implement REST endpoint mappings for hybrid workflows
4. Add derivative-specific field mappings

### Maintenance & Updates
- Weekly API change detection
- Automated regression testing
- Coverage degradation alerts
- Exchange health monitoring
