project_name: coinbase_catalog_to_json

language: python

purpose:
  Produce a JSON catalog/spec from vendor APIs (starting with Coinbase), for the application to ingest and configure data subscriptions (tick feeds, bar feeds, etc.).

objectives:
  - Fetch Coinbase API documentation.
  - Parse available data feeds (symbols, feed types, intervals).
  - Output a structured JSON catalog for application ingestion.
  - Prepare for future vendor differences by allowing a mapping mechanism from vendor fields to internal abstractions.

requirements:
  - Modular design: Break functions if >50 lines.
  - Each function must have a clear docstring.
  - First line of each file: comment with filename.
  - Use Python best practices (PEP8, clear error handling).
  - Include meaningful comments for clarity.
  - Implement basic logging for key steps and errors.

workflow:
  - Step 1: Fetch API docs. Halt on error; log issues.
  - Step 2: Parse feed details into internal structures. Halt on error; log issues.
  - Step 3: Output JSON catalog. Validate output; log success.

notes:
  - README must explain that the JSON catalog is for configuring app data subscriptions.
  - Expect future vendors; design for adaptable mapping. A secondary mapping JSON may be required to translate vendor-specific fields to internal abstractions.
  - After Python validation, a Go implementation will follow.
